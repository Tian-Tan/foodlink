          GBFB offers assistance with applications for the Supplemental Nutrition
          Assistance Program (SNAP), formerly known as food stamps. SNAP benefits
          are put on an electronic card that is used like an ATM or bank card, and
          can be used at most supermarkets, convenience stores, and some farmersâ€™
          markets.

          will include initiatives working toward this goal in areas such as
          improving access to healthy and affordable foods, reducing the amount of
          food wasted in homes and restaurants, and supporting local food producers
          and food businesses.

          Created in 1981, the Coalition embraces a collaborative approach to unify
          people and mobilize resources to support its mission. The Coalition has
          been committed to tackling difficult problems that impact families and
          individuals who are experiencing homelessness or at-risk of losing their
          homes. It works to maintain awareness of the accelerating challenges of
          poverty and homelessness. Seen as a leader and expert in its field, the
          agency is called upon by peer organizations and state agencies to share
          its knowledge and expertise. Since its origin, the Coalition has been
          committed to developing programs that meet an unmet need, which in turn
          leads to long-term solutions to poverty and homelessness.
